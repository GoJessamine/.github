## About GoJessamine
This page is intended those of us lucky enough to be true Jessamine countians.

For us true Jessamine county folks, homecoming or the Jamboree (if it's even remembered as that anymore) will never be the same again, that's because of the influx of new *real* Jessamine countians over the past few years.

It shouldn't have ever happened, but Jessamine county got made "IT" in this rich man's game of TAG.

[Learn about TAG](https://github.com/TAGIsNoGame/TAG) or [read what a homeboy](https://github.com/TAGIsNoGame/TAG/tree/master/PHB33) says about it to the folks playing the rich man's game in and around his apartment night and day.
